***
Multilingual RAG expands the capabilities of traditional RAG to support multiple languages. It integrates an embedding model trained in various languages, enabling the system to process and generate responses across different languages. Using this multilingual approach, the RAG system can handle queries in any language, retrieve relevant information regardless of its original language, and deliver accurate, contextually relevant answers in the userâ€™s preferred language.
